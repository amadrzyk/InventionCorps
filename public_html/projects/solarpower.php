                        <blockquote>
                            <p>For example, think about what the absence of refrigeration does to vaccine development or agriculture. Refrigerators are big, hulky, and expensive, which is challenging in a developing context. A few years back, laptops were also big and hulky, and companies wanted to figure out how to remove the fans and make them thinner. They developed a chip that takes the heat from the laptop and converts it into electricity. This technology was then used to develop a refrigerator for the bottom of the pyramid in India. Ninety percent of this research was done to make laptops work better, but with a few little twists we can apply it to a completely different issue: vaccines. </p>
